# SuspicionDetector (Computer vision side project)
#The Problem:
- 
people not being active and just idley standing by raise suspicion as their motives are unknown. Those who are waiting an unreasonable amount of time must be watched closely.

The Solution
-
the functionality of this detector is to raise the level of suspicion the longer someone is waiting around. the levels are associated with stars(yes, like GTA), with 5 stars being a menace to society/national security threat. I learned a lot while building this project and in the future hope to incorporate frame differencing techniques.
there are obviously some kinks and things to work out because i did not use any complex cv technique, i just used logic and common sense whcih unfortunately isnt enough sometimes. All in all i think the next steps would be to incorporate some background subtraction to optimize this program.
